# Shopping-Cart

The HTML/CSS of this project were given to me through a training program called WebDevSimplified. The id tags were added by me through the course of the project. The purpose of the project was to create a lifelike shopping cart utilzing the items in items.json and was able to be accessed across the three different pages.
